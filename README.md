# Stock Analysis with VBA

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
#### The purpose of this project was to help Steve analyize the stock market for a renewable energy company his parents can invest in.  After analyizing the data, we made the workbook more interactive so Steve could have a better visual representation of the stock market that he could show his parents. 

## Results
### Overall
#### Based on the results from 2017 and 2018, Steve should suggest to his parents to invest in stocks from either RUN or ENPH, favoring RUN just because their performance is still just slightly better than ENPH. Looking at all the stocks, the market's performance in 2017 did much better than in 2018 although the reason is unknown.
### Comparing Code
#### When comparing the original script's and the refactored script's performances, the refactored script executed the commands quicker than the orginal. 

## Summary
#### Some of the advantages to refactoring code is just like what happened in this example: the code ran faster. Refactoring the code means that we have the oppurtunity to shape up the code where we need to and condense it. A disadvantage to refactoring is that you are kind of fixing something that isn't broken. The only thing witht that is if something works why change it? Going back to the advange though, it would be better to have code run more effectively if possible. In the case of this example, refactoring the code made the analysis run faster for Steve to work with. The only real con to refactoring was taking more time to make the code run faster rather than just leaving the working code the way it was.
